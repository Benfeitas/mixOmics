\usage{
MultiModalSparsePLS(
  data,
  formula,
  keep_features = NULL,
  ncomp = 2,
  design = "full",
  scale = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{MultiAssayExperiment} object with matching cells/samples
across all experiments.}

\item{formula}{A formula of form LHS ~ RHS where LHS is an assay and RHS is 
a list of assays (e.g. assay_1 + assay_2 + ...)}

\item{keep_features}{Named list of number of features to keep on each component
and assay. See examples.}

\item{ncomp}{the number of components to include in the model. Default to 2.
Applies to all blocks.}

\item{design}{Matrix or character. Connects assays during integration.
Each value is a continuous number b/w 0 (not connected) and 1 (fully connected).
'null' will connect the LHS to all RHS only and 'full' will fully connect all
assays.}

\item{scale}{Logical. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
means and unit variances (default: TRUE)}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to mixOmics::block.spls}
}
\value{
A 'multimodal' object
}
